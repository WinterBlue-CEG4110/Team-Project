1. Download Unity Hub Setup Helper <a href="https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe"> from this link</a>

2. Open Unity Hub. Click the icon below the X in the top right to sign in, then click Register to create an account

3. Back in Unity Hub, click License Management, then Activate New License. In the dialog box that opens, select Unity Personal (When you click on it, it will ask if you are using it in a professional capacity, or if your organization makes less than $100,000. either option is fine), then Done.

4. In Unity Hub, click Installs, then click Unity 2021.3.34f1 (LTS), then next. We should not need any modules added to our install for our purposes.

5. To test that everything is working, go to projects, click new, and create a project (name it whatever you like, with whatever template and location).

6. OPTIONAL: If using Visual Studio Code, install C# Dev Kit by Microsoft (it will prompt you to login to get some bullshit microsoft benefits, but this can be safely ignored)

Looking up some basic how-tos on youtube or going through Unity's in-built tutorials is highly recommended! A lot of this project will be about learning as we go.
