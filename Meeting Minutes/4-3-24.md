# Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 4/3/2024

## Agenda
1. Review user stories
2. Discuss version 0.1 'release' 
3. Discuss process revisions



## Notes
* Everyone got all their user stories done!
* New ones have been assigned: Thavi and Long will be working on finishing out the enemy framework, Kha will be working on audio scripting, John will be finishing up menus
* Version 0.1 will release into main as soon as the last of the audio assets are put into test
* Process Revision: Branches will now be created out of Main. When breaking changes are going to be created, make a copy of the scene you want the changes applied to. Make your changes in that copy. When we are ready to merge/release, John will come in and combine everything into the scene. (this should prevent merge conflicts due to scene metadata)
