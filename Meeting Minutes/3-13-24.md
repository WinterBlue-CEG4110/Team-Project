# Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 3/13/2024

## Agenda
1. Refresher on github practices
2. Status updates on first enemy design and initial player design
3. GDD revision based on feedback
4. Sprint name, story pointing and assignment


## Notes
* Did a quick refresher on our github merge practices (main->Branch->test->main->...)
* Deadlines for first working enemy and player needs to be pushed back due to overwhelming workloads outside of this class.
* Started revising the GDD based on the feedback of other teams and the teacher.
    * In particular we needed to (and frankly still need to) flesh out what the enemies would look like, and the hybrid concept of auto-runner/space-shooter
* Created our first real sprint, story pointed our first stories

## Action Items
* Continue revising GDD (we weren't able to do everything in our meeting)
* Work on assigned stories
## Contributors
* John McGuff
