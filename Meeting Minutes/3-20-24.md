# Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 3/20/2024

## Agenda
1. Continue GDD Revisions
2. Sprint meeting
3. DSP discussion


## Notes
Created a story for revising the GDD- this will still be a shared responsibility. Each person will create their section of the revised GDD based on their team role,
then we will combine each section into a new GDD when we are finished.
-Long had an enemy to show off, Kha and Thavi are still working on their part
-Assigned a new story to John to get a Start Menu up and running.
-Pretty much all deadlines due today were pushed back significantly (We were a bit too ambitious thinking our MVP would be done today)
