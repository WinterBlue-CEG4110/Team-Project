# Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 2/7/2024

## Agenda
1. Check up on Unity Setup/Learning progress
2. Finalize game concept
3. Check in: How is everyone's semester going so far? :)

## Notes
- Not much progress on tutorializing Unity, but Kha linked a video from Game Maker's Toolkit that should help (we are still early and finalizing the game concept, so this isn't so bad)
- Fleshed out game concept: A 2d shooting game incorporating elements of classic 2d shooter games and auto-runners (IE Galaga x Subway Surfers)
- Everyone is doing okay so far (Data mining is a rough course)
## Action Items
* Continue learning Unity Engine
* Writeup finalized game concept
