## Development Methodology
* Agile: allows for flexibility and adaptability, which is crucial for game development where requirements may evolve during the project.
  * Discussion -> Planning -> Implementing -> Review -> Merge
    * Discuss issues and potential stories during weekly sprint meetings.
    * Plan sprints to tackle stories.
    * Implement the desired changes in code individually or collaboratively.
    * Conduct code reviews during sprint meetings and class time.
    * Merge changes into TEST branch for Quality Assurance (QA).
  * STORY BRANCH -> TEST -> MAIN
    * Feature/story development will occur on dedicated branches.
    * After code review, changes will be merged into the TEST branch for QA.
    * Once QA is passed, merge changes into MAIN branch.
## Milestones
