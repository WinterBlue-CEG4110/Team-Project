# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia
* Meeting details: cadence, method, minutes, etc.
Weekly Sprint Meetings: Once a week, Wednesdays, 8:45pm - 9:45pm, organized through discord. 
## Development Methodology
* Waterfall
Discussion -> Planning -> Implementing -> Review -> Merge 
STORY BRANCH -> TEST -> MAIN 
Discuss issues and potential stories, write stories and develop a plan to tackle them, implement the desired changes in code, have the team review the changes, then merge into TEST branch for QA. Once QA is passed, merge changes into MAIN.
## Milestones
* Important Milestones that some combine the development methodology with constraints you cannot change (e.g., how long the course is).
